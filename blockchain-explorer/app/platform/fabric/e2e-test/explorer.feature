Feature: Bootstrapping Hyperledger Explorer
    As a user I want to be able to bootstrap Hyperledger Explorer

# @sanity
# @doNotDecompose
# Scenario: Bring up explorer with tls-disabled fabric network and retrieve channel list successfully
#     Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type solo without tls
#     Given the NETWORK_PROFILE environment variable is solo-disabled
#     When an admin sets up a channel named "mychannel"
#     When I start explorer
#     Then the logs on explorer.mynetwork.com contains "Synchronizer pid is " within 10 seconds

#     Given I wait "5" seconds
#     Given I set base URL to "http://localhost:8090"
#     When I make a POST request to "auth/login" with parameters
#     |user  |password   |network        |
#     |test  |test       |first-network  |
#     Then the response status code should equal 200
#     Then the response structure should equal "loginResp"
#     Then JSON at path ".success" should equal true
#     Then JSON at path ".user.message" should equal "logged in"
#     Then JSON at path ".user.name" should equal "test"

#     Given JSON at path ".success" should equal true
#     Given I want to reuse "token" parameter
#     Given I set Authorization header to "context.token"
#     When I make a GET request to "api/channels"

Scenario Outline: [<network-type>] Bring up explorer with fabric-samples/<network-type> and send requests to the basic REST API functions successfully
    # Start a fabric network by using fabric-samples/<network-type>
    Given I start <network-type>
    # Need to specify which profiles should be in use before starting Explorer
    Given the NETWORK_PROFILE environment variable is <network-type>
    When I start explorer

    Given I want to reuse parameter "channel_genesis_hash" at path "channels[0].channel_genesis_hash"
    Given I want to reuse parameter "block_height" at path "channels[0].blocks"

    # Building API route path by using variables stored in the context
    When I make a GET request to the following path segment

    Then the response structure should equal "blockResp"
    Then JSON at path ".status" should equal 200

    When I make a GET request to "api/peersStatus/mychannel"
    Then the response status code should equal 200
    Then the response structure should equal "peersStatusResp"
    Then JSON at path ".status" should equal 200
    # TODO Currently the list in the response is empty

    When I make a GET request to the following path segment
    # api/blockActivity/<context.channel_genesis_hash>
    |path                           |

    |blockActivity                  |
    |context.channel_genesis_hash   |
    Then the response status code should equal 200
    Then the response structure should equal "blockactivityResp"
    Then JSON at path ".status" should equal 200
    Then JSON at path ".row[0].channelname" should equal "mychannel"
